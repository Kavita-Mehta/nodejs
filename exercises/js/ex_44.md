# Exercise 44

* Create a new index44.js file
* Define a text variable and assign the following value: HELLO
* Define a result variable
* Get each char from the text variable and revert the text assigning it to the result variable
* At the end you should be able to show the following text: OLLEH
* Once you reverted the text, transform it to lowercase
* Show the final output: `the final result is: olleh`
* It kind of sound spanish, right?.. ole!!! (lol)
