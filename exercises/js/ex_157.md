# Exercise 157

* Create a new index157.js 
* Copy and paste the code from exercise 156
* Refactor the code to match requirements
* At the beginning of the code define a console variable and assign one of the following values as string: PS4 or XBOX
* Iterate over the games array and filter to show only the ones which console property equals the selected console variable value
* Basically we filter games by PS4 or XBOX `using the array filter method`
