# Exercise 163

* Create a new index163.js
* Define a add function
* This function will return a numeric value with result of adding all the numbers that we pass as parameter
* As we don't know how many parameters we are going to get we need to use a dynamic way to add this functionality
* Call the add function passing 5 numbers and show the result as output
* Call the add function passing 10 numbers and show the result as output
