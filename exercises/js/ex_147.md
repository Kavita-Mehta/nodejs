# Exercise 147

* Create a new index147.js 
* Copy and paste the code from the previous exercise
* Refactor the code to match the requirements
* The shouldOpenBatCave function not longer accepts two parameters
* Now the shouldOpenBatCave function only accepts a user parameter
* Instead of calling the shouldOpenBatCave function passing username and password now we only pass the user object
* The rest of the code should still work the same way and show the proper output
