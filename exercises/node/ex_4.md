# Exercise 4

* Create the following folder/file structure:
```
/ex_4
  |-- index.js
```

* Init an NPM project inside the ex_4 folder
* Use ex_4 as project name
* Read the [one-liner-joke module documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/one-liner-joke) and learn to use it
* Install the one-liner-joke module
* Configure the start script so it runs index.js

## index.js
* Show a random joke as output
* Show the joke category as output
* Tip: the `getRandomJoke` returns an object that has a `body` property with the joke and a `tags` one with the categories
